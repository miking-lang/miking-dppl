# TreePPL â€“ A Universal Probabilistic Programming Language for Evolutionary Biology

Probabilistic programming techniques have developed rapidly in recent years. The ultimate vision is to provide expressive, universal, Turing-complete model description languages, while at the same time supporting the automated generation of efficient inference algorithms from these model descriptions. This would allow empiricists to easily and succinctly describe any model they might be interested in, relying on the automated machinery to provide efficient inference algorithms for that model.

Current probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are often difficult to use for empiricists. Furthermore, even though there is now swift progress in PPL inference strategies, there is still a substantial gap in many domains before PPL systems can compete successfully with dedicated software, or even provide computationally feasible solutions.

The aim of the TreePPL project is to develop a probabilistic programming language for evolutionary biology. These are our design goals:

1. **It is possible and easy to express any stochastic model in TreePPL.**

	- TreePPL is a _universal_ PPL meaning that any stochastic model that is computable can be expressed in it.

	- When describing algorithms the models are expressed in terms of data transformations (_functional_).

	- We support _vectorized_ operations in terms of data structures and in terms of language constructs such as map-reduce.

	- Last but not least, the syntax is based on the _familiar_ C/C++/JavaScript languages, drawing particular inspiration form [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/).
	
2. **TreePPL is especially well-suited for phylogenetics and evolutionary biology.**

	- It has a phylogenetic library of standard phylogenetic data structures (trees) and algorithms (diversification, biography, phylogeney inference, etc.).
	
	- Has optimized inference to work with phylogenetic data structures and is able to handle big phylogenetic datasets (> 10,000 species).
	
3. **TreePPL should support advanced users that want to experiment with inference algorithms or develop entirely new inference strategies for phylogenetic models.**
	
4. **TreePPL is a fast language.**

	- For fast prototyping a line-by-line (interpreted) execution is possible.
	
	- Thanks to type safety, it is find and remove bugs.
	
	- Programs can be compiled to efficient low-level code.

In a [recent paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.154443v3), we introduce probabilistic programming and develop efficient PPL approaches to advanced models of biological diversification, such as the BAMM model and the ClaDS models, using [WebPPL](http://webppl.org/) and another recent PPL, [Birch](http://webppl.org/). The paper demonstrates some of the potential power of probabilistic programming in statistical phylogenetics, and discusses the main hurdles that remain to be tackled before these techniques can be applied to the entire range of phylogenetic models.

TreePPL will be built on top of [Miking](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3357766.3359531), a language framework for constructing efficient compilers for domain-specific languages.

This web site will be continuously updated, with the ultimate aim of developing it into the primary online resource for the TreePPL community.
